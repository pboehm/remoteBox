# remoteBox

Sinatra App that gives you access to content of your Dropbox. It will be used
to host documents out of Dropbox to other users. It is designed to be deployed
on Heroku.

> based on dropbox-sdk-example web_file_browser.rb

## Configuration

remoteBox is configured through environment variables, because Heroku allows
you to set them through the `heroku` command. For local development you should
set them at command line:

```
$ APP_KEY=.... APP_SECRET=.... ACCESS_TOKEN=.... ACCESS_SECRET=.... \
AUTH_USERNAME=user AUTH_PASSWORD=password bundle exec shotgun

== Shotgun/Thin on http://0.0.0.0:9393/
>> Thin web server (v1.5.1 codename Straight Razor)
>> Maximum connections set to 1024
>> Listening on 0.0.0.0:9393, CTRL+C to stop
```
